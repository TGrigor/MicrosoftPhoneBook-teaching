# Simple Phone Number Storage Application

## Overview
This project is a C# WPF application developed as part of a live coding event hosted by the Microsoft Innovation Center in Armenia. It serves as an educational tool, demonstrating to students the end-to-end process of creating a simple application for storing phone numbers in a database. Approximately 50 students participated in this event, gaining insights into application development and enhancing their practical coding skills.

## Features
- **Database Integration**: Students learn how to perform basic database operations such as create, read, update, and delete (CRUD).
- **User Interface**: The application includes a basic user interface developed with WPF, showcasing the application of user interface principles in software development.
- **Live Coding Demonstration**: The project is the result of a live coding session, providing students with real-time coding experience.

## Educational Impact
The main purpose of this event was to:
- **Demonstrate the Application Creation Process**: Students observed the step-by-step development of an application, from conceptualization to execution.
- **Skill Assessment and Improvement**: After the event, students were interviewed to evaluate their skills, with the aim of providing targeted advice for improvement.
